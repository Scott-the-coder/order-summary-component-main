### Links

- Solution URL: 
- Live Site URL: 

## My process

I started on this site from the mobile view first and then moved onto desktop media query to change the scaling on larger screens.
I added all my divs and tags firstly, then moved onto add the styles of font and colors to my CSS.
Then I added my display options for boxes and padded to match the sample images.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

I learned to start with mobile first design to reduce my code and then add in a minimal amount of media query lines to adapt to a larger screen.
I also learned to reduce my divs as I can style my code without using divs on specific tags such as headings and paragraphs.

### Continued development

I intend to keep practicing minimalising the amount of containers/divs so I don't need to use as much code.
I also still want to practice media query as I have only touched on this slightly so far and I am still not fully familiar with this style a parameters yet.
